## 🔍 Overview

This project is an **AI-Based E-Gate Management System** designed to automate gate access control using intelligent technologies.  
It is divided into **two main modules**:

1. **Facial Recognition System** – Authenticates individuals in real-time using LBPH-based face recognition.
2. **Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System** – Detects and verifies vehicle license plates using the Gemini API.

Together, these modules enhance security, reduce manual effort, and streamline access at institutional gates.

### Key Highlights:
- 🧠 Face recognition using **LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)**
- 🚘 Number plate recognition using **Gemini API**
- 🖥️ Admin interface for real-time monitoring, registration, and access control
- 🗂️ MySQL database integration for logging and verification
